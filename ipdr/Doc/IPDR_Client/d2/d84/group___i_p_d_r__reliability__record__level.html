TCP is not sufficient for quick detection of failure; and the standard implementations do not allow application-level acknowledgment. Therefore, IPDR provides an application-level acknowledgment mechanism. The protocol leaves some flexibility in the implementation. The current implementation batches up acknowledgments for efficiency as described below.<p>
The IPDR transmitters (clients) and collectors (servers) use the host systems' TCP stacks. If desired, these can be tuned to handle situations such as "long fat pipes" or to have increased socket buffers. However, our experience is that the default values work well for data rates to at least 5000 records/second on a LAN.<p>
IPDR implementation focuses on time-outs, with the following main points (most of the timeouts can be configured to different values, if desired): <ul>
<li>
Data records are sent from the exporter to the collector (server) as soon as possible (the TCP stack usually will try to combine multiple records into a single packet using the Nagle algorithm, which typically has a time-out of 200 milliseconds; the IPDR implementation leaves this processing enabled). </li>
<li>
10 seconds time-out for the transmitter (client) to not get an acknowledgment from the collector (server). The timer is started when the first record is sent. The timer is re-set whenever an acknowledgment is received that acknowledges at least one new record (that is, "keep-alive" acknowledgments are ignored by the timer, so that if the collector is too busy to process records, the behavior is the same as if the collector were disconnected or crashed). </li>
</ul>
