 *
 *  The largest amount of time is given to testing. This can

 *
 *  To help avoid confusion, throughout this document we have added
 *  the glosses "transmitter" and "collector" to "client" and "server"
 *  respectively.
 *
 *  A more detailed terminology list is given in the section

/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_determine_needs Cookbook: Determine needs
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  Considerations for transmitting data:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>What kind of data will be transmitted?
 *  <li>Are there better tools to use instead?
 *  <li>Will it also work for future needs?
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  As its name states, IPDR is designed for sending "accounting"
 *  type data from network elements. IPDR is superior to the following
 *  following output mechanisms:
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt>SNMP (MIBs): <dd>IPDR can efficiently send much higher
 *      rates of data, and more reliably (SNMP is based on UDP).
 *      Also, IPDR is push-oriented, so the network element
 *      can control the rate at which data is sent (conventional
 *      SNMP leaves the network element at the mercy of the
 *      network management system's polling).
 *  <dt>Log files: <dd>IPDR avoids the need for disk space on
 *      network element. Also, it is a binary protocol, so precious
 *      processing time is not used in converting data to an ASCII
 *      or XML representation.
 *  <dt>RADIUS accounting: <dd>IPDR avoids some of the scalability
 *      issues of RADIUS; it is more reliable and has a simpler
 *      interface (the IPDR API handles issues of fail-over that
 *      typically must be explicitly programmed when using RADIUS).
 *  <dt>TCP sockets: <dd>IPDR takes care of the assembly and
 *      disaassembly of records and negotiation of content.
 *      It is also provides application-level reliability, to acknowledge
 *      when records have been processsed (TCP reliability only verifies
 *      that records have arrived) and supports fail-over to multiple
 *      collectors.
 *  </dl>
 *
 *  The main requirements that were used to design the protocol were:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Aimed at accounting/logging needs: the data are structured
 *      into individual records with well-defined fields. Multiple record
 *      types are allowed.
 *  <li>Real-time: minimal latency to deliver records.
 *  <li>Scalable: support multiple devices at over 1000 records/sec each.
 *  <li>Flexible: the transmitter (client) defines the data records and can change
 *      the content by adding new fields or by defining new record
 *      "templates".
 *  <li>Reliable: ensures that every record is delivered and processed.
 *  <li>Efficient: the protocol is as light-weight as possible
 *      (network elements spend their time doing network-related
 *      work and don't want to "waste" processing power on non-core
 *      tasks.
 *  <li>Easy to deploy: simple API.
 *  <li>Portable: all operating system functions are isolated for
 *      portability, so if you have an esoteric operating system
 *      that nobody else uses, the chances are good that IPDR
 *      can be quickly ported to it.
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  IPDR isn't for everybody. If you don't care about reliability,
 *  just use standard TCP sockets or even UDP. If you don't care about
 *  flexibility, hard-code your record formats. If you want free-form
 *  data transfer, IPDR might not do what you want. If you want
 *  two-way communication, consider some other protocol, such as HTTP
 *  or RADIUS (although IPDR is being extended to handle certain
 *  kinds of two-way communication, mainly additional acknowledgment
 *  from the collector (server), such as authorization).
 *
 *  IPDR's flexibility is important for future-proofing your investment.
 *  You can add new record types and fields at any time, simply by installing
 *  a new version of your software that defines them.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbookcollectors Cookbook: Determine downstream processing needs
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  In an ideal world, you could just output your accounting data in the
 *  form that's most convenient for you. In reality, you need to think a bit
 *  about how the data will be used.
 *
 *  If you're outputting multiple kinds of data, you must have some
 *  way of distinguishing one kind of data from another -- IPDR
 *  multiplexes all records into a single record, with unused data
 *  fields marked as "null".
 *
 *  IPDR handles data with a variable number of fields the same way
 *  that a relational database handles data. For example, if you have
 *  master information and a list of details, you must instead send
 *  the master information by itself, with a separate record for each
 *  detail (and the detail records must have a field that allows
 *  matching them with the master record).
 *
 *  For example, suppose a mail server wishes to output each message's
 *  sender and list of recipients. This can be done by defining two
 *  records:
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt>message: <dd>timestamp, msgID, sender, ...
 *  <dt>recipientDetail: <dd>msgID, receiver
 *  </dl>
 *  This has an obvious implementation in a SQL database, allowing
 *  a query to get the sender and all recipients for a message by
 *  doing a "join" on the msgID:
 *  <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;timestamp,&nbsp;sender,&nbsp;receiver
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;message,&nbsp;recipientDetail
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHERE&nbsp;message.msgID&nbsp;=&nbsp;receipient.msgID</code>
 *
 *  Other processing needs include:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Whether to send timestamps in local time or UTC (GMT) ... UTC is
 *      usually better.
 *  <li>How to identify the sender (e.g., the sender's IP address).
 *  <li>Whether to send absolute values or deltas (if absolute values,
 *      how to handle overflow; if deltas, how to handle situations
 *      of data loss, as described in @ref IPDR_cookbook_events).
 *  <li>How to describe missing data situations (e.g., zero-lengh string,
 *      a separate field that indicates missing data).
 *  <li>How to uniquely identify a record, for deduplication. In general,
 *      this is not a problem because the IPDR protocol provides a
 *      transmitter (client) boot time and sequence number for each record. However,
 *      the sequence number can wrap around, so if deduplication is done
 *      over large sets of records, some additional field(s) must be
 *      used to uniquely identify records.
 *  <li>If multiple records are output at one time (e.g.,
 *      statistics tables), whether these must be locked from
 *      update while the data are being output.
 *  </ul>
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_templates Cookbook: Define templates
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  After you have determined what data needs to be transmitted and the
 *  broad form of its format (see @ref IPDR_cookbookcollectors).
 *
 *  If you are starting from scratch, you simply define a C or C++
 *  structure which contains the data that you wish to send.
 *  Continuing with the example given in @ref IPDR_cookbookcollectors,
 *  there could be two C structures:
 *  <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;struct&nbsp;message&nbsp;{
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;type;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;'M'&nbsp;for&nbsp;message
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;&nbsp;timestamp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;seconds&nbsp;since&nbsp;00:00:00&nbsp;UTC&nbsp;1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1970
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;&nbsp;msgID;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;unique&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;message
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;sender[100];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;null-terminated
 *  <br>}</code>
 *  <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;struct&nbsp;recipientDetail&nbsp;{
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;type;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;'R'&nbsp;for&nbsp;recipient
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;&nbsp;msgID;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;unique&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;message
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;recipient[100];&nbsp;//&nbsp;null-terminated
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code>
 *
 *  Next, a unique identifier must be defined for each field:
 *  <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;enum&nbsp;{
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typeKeyID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;1;
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timestampKeyID&nbsp;=&nbsp;2;&nbsp;
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;msgIDKeyID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;3;
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;senderKeyID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;4;
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receipient_id&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;5;
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>}
 *
 *  This information must be communicated to the IPDR transmitter (client), using
 *  the ::IPDR_Key data type. For example, the "sender" field
 *  would be defined:
 *  <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;senderKeyID,&nbsp;XDR_TYPE_STRING,&nbsp;"sender",&nbsp;"",&nbsp;"",&nbsp;0,
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPDR_ACCESS_BY_OFFSET,&nbsp;NULL,
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(IPDR_KeyAccessor(offsetof(struct&nbsp;message,&nbsp;sender)))&nbsp;</code>}
 *
 *  These key definitions are combined into templates and passed
 *  to the IPDR_CreateTemplate() function. The result is a "template
 *  handle", which is used when calling IPDR_SendData().
 *
 *  Not all situations can be handled so simply. If the internal record
 *  structure does not match the desired output format, there are two
 *  possible solutions:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>Create records in the desired format, copy the fields into
 *      them, and output directly.
 *  <li>Use the #IPDR_ACCESS_BY_FUNCTION option, with a ::IPDR_KeyAccessor
 *      function to return a pointer to the data.
 *  </ol>
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_send Cookbook: Send data
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The network element determines when to send data, and uses the
 *  IPDR_SendData() function, with the appropriate "template handle"
 *  (from IPDR_CreateTemplate()) and the record
 *  data. IPDR_SendData() queues the data for the
 *  sending thread. The sending thread takes care of transmitting to
 *  the primary or secondary collector (server), handling fail-over, and removing
 *  the record when it is positively acknowledged by the collector (server).
 *
 *  IPDR_SendData() is non-blocking (assuming use of the
 *  multi-threaded implementation of the platform-specific functions),
 *  so there is no need for a separate thread for outputting data.
 *
 *  For situations where the copy operation is too expensive,
 *  the API has provision for "external queuing", allowing the
 *  platform to handle the sent data explicitly.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_events Cookbook: Error and event handling
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  Even though IPDR is a reliable protocol, it cannot perform magic.
 *  In particular, if all the collectors (servers) are down or the network connection
 *  to them is broken, data will be lost (see @ref IPDR_cookbook_sizing
 *  for how to set the parameters for limiting such data loss).
 *
 *  Because data sending and acknowledgment is asynchronous to the
 *  IPDR_SendData() calls, any errors or collector (server) status change events
 *  are communicated via ::IPDR_EventCallbackDetailed (set by
 *  IPDR_SetExporterEventHandlerDetailed()). The most recent event and
 *  other statistical information can also be examined by
 *  IPDR_GetServerStatisticsAndState().
 *
 *  THe exception to this is if something goes wrong with the main
 *  read/timer loop, which has no ability to communicate its
 *  status. When it has a problem, it writes a log message (if
 *  possible) and sets its status to not running,
 *
 *  The following errors may be handled:
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt>#IPDR_EVENT_RECORD_LOST
 *  <dd>The internal queue filled up and the record
 *      was thrown away.
 *  </dl>
 *
 *  The following events may be handled. Typically, these are used
 *  for status indication.
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt>#IPDR_EVENT_SERVER_CONNECTED
 *  <dd>A collector (server) has become available
 *  <dt>#IPDR_EVENT_SERVER_DISCONNECTED
 *  <dd>A collector (server) has become unavailable, either because
 *      it was stopped or because a network timeout occurred.
 *  <dt>#IPDR_EVENT_ACTIVE_SERVER_CHANGED
 *  <dd>A higher priority collector (server) has become active and the
 *      transmitter (client) has switched back to using it.
 *  <dt>#IPDR_EVENT_QUEUE_EMPTY
 *  <dd>All queued records have been acknowledged by the collector (server)
 *      and it can be safely shut down.
 *  </dl>
 *
 *  The transmitter (client) code also can generate log messages. The verbosity
 *  level is set by IPDR_SetModuleDebugLevel(). For more on this,
 *  see @ref IPDR_cookbook_integration_monitoring.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_sizing Cookbook: Sizing
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The various internal memory areas can have their maximum size
 *  limited. This prevents the IPDR transmitter (client) from using all the memory
 *  resources and stopping other processing on the network element.
 *  Details of all the values are given in IPDR_configuration_values.
 *  The most important is <code>configuration.queueMaxMemory</code>.

 *
 *  Using these, you can calculate how much memory must be reserved

/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_integration_configuration Cookbook: Integrating configuration
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The IPDR transmitter (client) API defines all its configuration values by
 *  a name and a MIB OID. There are two mechanisms for configuration:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>A callback for mapping a name to a value (::IPDR_ParametersHandlerFunc,
 *      set by IPDR_InitExporter()). For example, you might use this if
 *      you do configuration with a Windows-style ".INI" file by simply reading
 *      the name=value pairs into a hash table; the callback is just a few lines
 *      of code, looking up the name to get the associated value.
 *  <li>A MIB value. You could use these if you use SNMP SET on the
 *      configuraiton values.
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  The ::IPDR_ParametersHandlerFunc is called only when the IPDR
 *  transmitter (client) is initialized. If you wish to change a value, you must
 *  stop the transmitter and restart it (see @ref
 *  IPDR_cookbook_integration_start_stop for more on this).
 *
 *  When a MIB value is changed, the transmitter (client) is reconfigured.
 *  This may cause the transmitter to briefly disconnect from the collector (server),
 *  but does not cause any data loss.
 *
 *  The ::IPDR_LoadMIBFunc callback is defined in IPDR_InitExporter() and
 *  can be used to get initial MIB values from some non-volatile memory.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_integration_start_stop Cookbook: Integrating IPDR transmitter (client) start/stop
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  When the network element has initialized itself and is ready to send data,
 *  it must first start the IPDR transmitter (client). As described in @ref IPDR_usage_steps,
 *  this consists of:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>Initialize the platform-specific services (e.g., with GenericPlatform_Initialize()).
 *  <li>Start the transmitter (client) with IPDR_InitExporter() and appropriate callbacks
 *      (::IPDR_ParametersHandlerFunc, ::IPDR_LoadMIBFunc, ::IPDR_SaveMIBFunc).
 *  <li>Create a session with IPDR_CreateSession().
 *  <li>Define the collectors (servers) with IPDR_AddCollector().
 *  <li>Add templates with IPDR_CreateTemplate().
 *  <li>Start the transmitter (client) with IPDR_StartExporter().
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  Once these steps are done, IPDR_SendData() can be used.
 *
 *  You can add or delete collectors (servers) at any time.
 *
 *  When you wish to shut down the IPDR data delivery, you should do:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>IPDR_DrainQueue(), to ensure that all data has been sent
 *      and acknowledged (this step is optional).
 *  <li>IPDR_DeleteExporter() to stop and remove the IPDR transmitter (client).
 *  <li>IPDR_PlatformServices::Delete() to remove any
 *      platform-specific resources.
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  You can stop and start the transmitter (client) as many times as you want;
 *  there are no "global" values that are kept around between
 *  invocations. You can also run multiple transmitters (clients) if you want,
 *  although this would be rather uncommon (multiple sessions
 *  would usually be a better method).

/** @defgroup IPDR_cookbook_integration_MIB Cookbook: Integrating the IPDR MIB
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The IPDR MIB can be integrated with the platform's MIB by using these
 *  callback functions:
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt>IPDR_MIBGet(): <dd>Find a specific MIB value, given the OID.
 *  <dt>IPDR_MIBGetNext(): <dd>Find the next MIB value (used for "walking" the MIB).

/** @defgroup IPDR_system_overview IPDR system overview
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The IPDR transmitter is a library of functions and structures that
 *  allows a network element to transmit accounting data using the IPDR
 *  protocol. The transmitter is designed to be readily ported to (embedded
 *  in) any platform and host application. It communicates with the
 *  platform's Host Application via the API described herein, and with
 *  the local (RT)OS via an abstraction layer. The schematic structure
 *  of the NE's software, showing the IPDR transmitter's position in the
 *  architecture, is given below:
 *
 *  @htmlonly
 *  <table border=1 align=center>
 *  <tr><th colspan=3>Host Application</th></tr>

 *  @endhtmlonly
 *
 *  The transmitter (client) is internally separated into transport
 *  and data layers, which communicate via a separate, internal API
 *  (not described in this document). The initial version of the
 *  transmitter is based on a TCP transport layer (which does not meet
 *  all the protocol requirements). Future versions may be based on
 *  the fully adequate SCTP transport [An initial negotiation over
 *  UDP, which will not vary from version to version, allows, among
 *  other things, specification of the transport. This negotiation
 *  could determine the protocol versions supported by the transmitter
 *  (client) and the collector (server) and result in utilization of
 *  the appropriate version.]
 *
 *  The IPDR transmitter (client) is implemented as an ANSI C library, designed to
 *  run on all the most popular operating systems used on NEs. It
 *  includes an abstraction layer to facilitate porting, and services
 *  accessible from the API, which allow vendors to specify data
 *  transmit fields and formats.
 *
 *  Functions in the API can be divided into two categories. The
 *  first, including platform services, are implemented by the host
 *  application and passed to the IPDR transmitter (client) library during the
 *  initialization process. Functions in the second category are
 *  called by the host application to define templates, keys and
 *  target collectors (servers), and generate and transmit accounting records.
 *
 *  The API is described in more detail in IPDR.h.
 *
 *  The sources are organized as follows:
 *  <ul>

/** @defgroup IPDR_special_considerations_multi_threading Multi-threading
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  All the functions in the API are multi-thread safe. This means
 *  that separate threads can call functions in the API without any
 *  need to put specific locks around them.
 *
 *  Unless otherwise specified, none of the functions block on I/O (in
 *  general, a socket can block until buffer space is available or
 *  TPC-level acknowledgments have been received). However, this
 *  behavior depends on proper implementation of the platform
 *  abstraction layer, in particular by using non-blocking socket
 *  receive and send functions.
 *
 *  When the IPDR transmitter (client) library operates in a multi-threaded
 *  environment, the following behavior is assumed:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>
 *  A single lockable entity is provided by the abstraction layer,
 *  which is activated by the Lock, Unlock functions (such as a single
 *  mutex, semaphore or a similar mechanism).
 *  <li>
 *  The above entity is automatically locked by the abstraction
 *  layer before callbacks are triggered by the abstraction layer
 *  (such as timer and read / write notification callbacks).

 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_usage_steps Steps for implementing a IPDR transmitter (client)
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>
 *  Write a platform-dependent implementation for the required
 *  services (memory allocation, timers, non-volatile memory)
 *  and set up an appropriate ::IPDR_PlatformServices structure.
 *  This is necessary only if the target platform is not POSIX,
 *  Linux, Solaris, or VxWorks.
 *  <li>
 *  For any template that will be transmitted as accounting data from
 *  the application, define keys corresponding to the structure's
 *  fields. For each key, write suitable sccessor function, if
 *  required. Define the template with a vector IPDR_Key values.
 *  <li>Call the appropriate platform-dependent intialization
 *  routine for the ::IPDR_PlatformServices structure described in #1
 *  (such as GenericPlatform_Initialize()).
 *  <li>
 *  Call IPDR_InitExporter() along with a pointer to the platform
 *  services structure containing references to the functions
 *  implemented in (1). Configuration can be done using
 *  the IPDR_ParametersHandlerFunc callback and the ::IPDR_LoadMIBFunc
 *  callback.
 *  <li>
 *  Create a session using IPDR_CreateSession().
 *  <li>
 *  Associate one or more collectors (servers) with the session (using IPDR_AddCollector()).
 *  <li>
 *  Add templates using IPDR_CreateTemplate(), using keys defined in #2.
 *  <li>
 *  Start the transmitter (client) with IPDR_StartExporter().
 *  <li>
 *  Use IPDR_SendData() to send accounting records.
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  Optional steps, which should be done before calling IPDR_StartExporter():
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>
 *  Define event handling, using IPDR_SetExporterEventHandlerDetailed().
 *  <li>
 *  Define handling of template negotiation, where the collector (server) does not
 *  need all the fields, using IPDR_SetTemplateChangedCallback().
 *  This is needed only if the platform can save processing by not
 *  generating data for unneeded fields.
 *  <li>
 *  Bind IPDR MIB into the platform MIB, using IPDR_MIBGet()
 *  and IPDR_MIBGetNext() and IPDR_MIBSet(). During transmitter (client) startup,
 *  the ::IPDR_LoadMIBFunc callback can be used to populate the
 *  configuration parameters in the MIB.
 *  <li>
 *  Bind logging into the platform logging, using
 *  IPDR_SetLogOutputCallbackDetailed().
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  Optional steps, after IPDR_StartExporter():
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>
 *  Monitor progress using IPDR_GetSessionStatistics() or
 *  IPDR_GetServerStatisticsAndState(). You would do this
 *  if the default statistic messages (set by
 *  <code>configuration.statisticsInterval</code>)
 *  are not to your liking.
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  Shut-down is done by:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>IPDR_DrainQueue(), if desired.
 *  <li>IPDR_DeleteExporter().
 *  <li>IPDR_PlatformServices::Delete().
 *  </ol>

/** @defgroup IPDR_usage_template Template structure recommendations
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The following are only of consideration if there are extreme
 *  performance issues.
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>
 *  For best performance, access keys by offsets and use only fixed
 *  length keys. When using this scenario it's better to group keys
 *  which are mandatory together (i.e. in a consecutive memory
 *  region), which will result in reducing the overhead a bit.
 *  <li>
 *  If possible use a single type of access to all keys.
 *  <li>
 *  Using accessor function implies the overhead of a function call
 *  per key (which was configured to access by function) for each
 *  record.
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  The IPDR transmitter (client) differentiates internally among six types of
 *  templates, depending on the key types and the accessor types of
 *  keys. The template's types are:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>All keys are accessed by offsets and all keys are fixed length.
 *  <li>All keys are accessed by functions and all keys are fixed length.
 *  <li>There is a mixture of functions and offsets and all keys are
 *  fixed length.
 *  <li>All keys are accessed by offsets and there are variable length keys.
 *  <li>All keys are accessed by functions and there are variable length keys.
 *  <li>There is a mixture of functions and offsets and there are

/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_base_transport Base transport (TCP)
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  IPDR is designed to work on top of any reliable transport. The
 *  current implementation uses TCP but advantage could also be taken
 *  of SCTP in the future.
 *
 *  TCP is reliable in the following sense:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Check-sums are calculated to ensure data integrity.
 *  <li>TCP handles out-of-order and duplicate packets, to provide a
 *    reliable stream of bytes (i.e., all the packet handling is done by
 *    TCP; this allows IPDR records to be split across packets,
 *    transparently to the application).
 *  <li>TCP retransmits packets if they are not acknowledged in
 *    time. This is transparent to the application, which only sees a
 *    stream of bytes.
 *  <li>If packets cannot be delivered, eventually an error indication
 *    will be generated. However, the time for this is
 *    implementation-defined, and can be hours.
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  In addition, TCP provides congestion control. TCP depends on IP
 *  for alternative routing of packets in an unreliable network.
 *
 *  TCP does not provide application-level reliability. It only
 *  handles delivery of packets to the receiving machine. Applications
 *  that need the highest level of reliability must provide their own
 *  reliability mechanism.
 *
 *  The TCP connection is made from the collector (server) to the
 *  transmitter (client). If there are multiple collectors (servers), there will be
 *  multiple connections to the transmitter; however only one is "active"
 *  at any time (the transmitter's configuration allows setting the
 *  priority of the collectors (servers)).
 *
 *  Whenever a collector (server) loses connectivity with the transmitter (either
 *  because the network connection has broken in such a way that TCP
 *  sees the break; or because the transmitter has switched to another
 *  collector), the collector tries repeatedly to connect to the transmitter.
 *
 *  There is no communication between the various collectors (servers) that are
 *  receiving data for any particular transmitter(s).
 *
 *  The collector (server) can be configured so that a single collector (server) can receive from
 *  one or multiple transmitters. In general, it is recommended to have one
 *  transmitter (client) to one collector (server) unless the data rates are very low, in which
 *  case it is easier to configure multiple transmitters to a single collector (server).
 *
 *  From a performance point of view, there is no significant
 *  difference between having multiple transmitters or a single transmitter to
 *  one collector (server). For configuration, a single collector (server) and multiple
 *  transmitters are easier to set up.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_record_level IPDR record-level reliability (fail-over)
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  TCP is not sufficient for quick detection of failure; and the
 *  standard implementations do not allow application-level
 *  acknowledgment. Therefore, IPDR provides an application-level
 *  acknowledgment mechanism. The protocol leaves some flexibility in
 *  the implementation. The current implementation batches up
 *  acknowledgments for efficiency as described below.
 *
 *  The IPDR transmitters (clients) and collectors (servers) use the
 *  host systems' TCP stacks. If desired, these can be tuned to handle
 *  situations such as "long fat pipes" or to have increased socket
 *  buffers. However, our experience is that the default values work
 *  well for data rates to at least 5000 records/second on a LAN.
 *
 *  IPDR implementation focuses on time-outs, with the
 *  following main points (most of the timeouts can be configured to
 *  different values, if desired):
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Data records are sent from the exporter to the collector (server) as soon as
 *    possible (the TCP stack usually will try to combine multiple records into
 *    a single packet using the Nagle algorithm, which typically has a
 *    time-out of 200 milliseconds; the IPDR implementation leaves this
 *    processing enabled).
 *  <li>10 seconds time-out for the transmitter (client) to not get an
 *    acknowledgment from the collector (server).
 *   The timer is started when the first record is sent. The timer
 *      is re-set whenever an acknowledgment is received that acknowledges
 *      at least one new record (that is, "keep-alive" acknowledgments are
 *      ignored by the timer, so that if the collector is too busy to
 *      process records, the behavior is the same as if the collector were
 *      disconnected or crashed).
 *  </ul>
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_protocol Details of the protocol's implementation: acknowledgment, fail-over and fail-back
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  To be more precise, the fail-over and fail-back mechanism is as follows
 *  (this description is somewhat specific to IPDR Collector; other
 *  implementations are possible but should follow this design in its main points):
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>A record is sent (via IPDR_SendData()) and the 10-second
 *    timer is started [10 seconds is the default; it can be
 *    changed]. The sent record is saved in a queue on the transmitter (client) in
 *    case it is not acknowledged.
 *  <li>Subsequent records do not change the timer, which continues to
 *    count down. These records are also saved in a queue on the transmitter (client).
 *  <li>The records are received at the collector (server), batched (for efficiency)
 *    and enqueued to some persistent queue implementation).
 *  <li>Every 1 second, a timer on the collector (server) causes an ACK to be sent
 *    with the sequence number of the record most recently enqueued. [The timer interval can be changed.]
 *  <li>When the transmitter (client) receives the ACK, it deletes all saved
 *    (queued) records up to this sequence number. If there is at least
 *    one saved (enqueued) record on the transmitter, the timer is started
 *    again (as in step 1 and processing continues as at step 2. If
 *    there are no saved (enqueued) records, the timer is turned off and
 *    processing continues as at step 1
 *    <ul><li>This processing happens only the ACK increments the
 *      sequence number (that is, if it isn't a "keep-alive"
 *      ACK). Otherwise, the ACK is ignored and the timer continues to
 *      run.
 *    </ul>
 *  <li>If the acknowledgment timer expires, it is assumed that the
 *    collector (server) has crashed or become "stuck". This causes the
 *    connection to be broken to the primary collector (server). All the saved
 *    (queued) records are sent to the secondary collector (server) and the
 *    10-second timer is started. Processing continues as at step 2.
 *  <li>While sending to the secondary collector (server), if an ACK is received
 *    from the primary collector, the connection to the secondary collector is
 *    dropped and processing continues as at step 5.
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  The 1-second interval by the collector (server) in sending acknowledgments is
 *  an efficiency consideration to avoid sending an acknowledgment for
 *  every record. A record is eligible for acknowledgment only after
 *  it has been persisted.
 *
 *  There is a 1 to 10 second time-out for the collector (server) to
 *  re-try connecting to the transmitter (client) if the TCP
 *  connection is lost. (Initial connection is tried at 1-second
 *  intervals and is gradually increased to 10 seconds if there is no
 *  response). Again, this value is configurable.
 *
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_failover Fail-over event display
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  When a time-out occurs or the TCP connection is lost, the transmitter (client)
 *  fails over to the secondary collector (server). It also generates an "event"
 *  which the host can display and/or write to a log. The transmitter
 *  breaks the TCP connection, so that the collector (server) will reset its
 *  internal state and try to reconnect (e.g., if it has been too
 *  busy to acknowledge).
 *
 *  When fail-over occurs, the IPDR code automatically re-sends all
 *  unacknowledged records to the secondary collector (server) (no special event
 *  is signaled for this; however a signal is generated for the change
 *  from primary to secondary collector). Because it is possible that a
 *  record has been received and processed but not acknowledged (e.g.,
 *  if the connection went down just when the acknowledgment was being
 *  sent), duplicate records may exist. The processing for this is
 *  described in more detail below.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_failback IPDR record-level reliability (fail-back)
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  When the primary collector (server) comes back online, it connects to the
 *  transmitter (client), which switches back to transmitting to the primary
 *  collector (server). The transmitter treats this situation as if the secondary
 *  collector (server) had failed (that is, it ignores any further acknowledgments
 *  from the secondary) and retransmits all unacknowledged
 *  records. This behavior is slightly inefficient, because it could
 *  retransmit some records that have already processed by the
 *  secondary collector (server) and simply haven't been acknowledged; however,
 *  the decision was made to use simpler and more robust code rather
 *  than try to be of the utmost efficiency in a fairly rare
 *  situation.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_transmitter_failure transmitter (client) failure
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The IPDR transmitter (client) maintains a queue (memory based)
 *  of unacknowledged records (TCP buffering may also means that some
 *  of these have not been sent either). If the transmitter crashes, the
 *  contents of this queue will be lost.
 *
 *  If collector (server) fail-over takes too long, the queue can fill up
 *  and records will be lost (the IPDR code detects this and raises
 *  an event).
 *
 *  <!-- &times; is also ï¿½(0xfc) but doxygen doesn't understand -->
 *  Proper sizing of the queue is: maximum-records-per-second ï¿½ *  (average-record-length + 16) ï¿½worst-case-failover-time. (The "16"
 *  is for the overhead of each IPDR record).
 *  In calculating average record length, use average string lengths,
 *  plus room for length value or null terminator, as appropriate.
 *
 *  The parameter is <code>configuration.queueMaxMemory</code> in
 *  section @ref IPDR_configuration_values.
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_other Other failure conditions
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  There are a number of more rare failure conditions. Most are
 *  handled by the mechanism given above (e.g., if an ICMP record
 *  indicates that a remote machine is unavailable, the underlying TCP
 *  stack should translate this into an error condition, which will
 *  cause the IPDR transmitter (client) or collector (server) to disconnect).
 *
 *  The transmitter (client) code has been made "robust", by detecting conditions
 *  such as the same collector attempting to create multiple
 *  connections. In this case, all connections to the collector are
 *  broken, allowing the collector to reset and make a single new
 *  connection. (This provides a possible denial-of-service security
 *  hole, but it is assumed that the network elements are inside a
 *  protected network ... the reason for breaking all connections is
 *  that there are some unusual error situations where a "stale"
 *  connection can persist, preventing the collector (server) from making a new
 *  connection.)
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_internal_queue Internal queue sizing
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  The parameter <code>configuration.queueMaxMemory</code>
 *  (see @ref IPDR_configuration_values) controls the size of the
 *  internal queue. It can be set to 0 (meaning <i>unlimited</i>).
 *  If a limit is set, it should be:
 *  <br>
 *  maximum-records-per-second ï¿½ *         (average-record-length + 16) ï¿½worst-case-failover-time.
 *
 *  (16 is the length of the IPDR record header.)
 *
 *  When the queue fills up, each <em>new</em> record is thrown away
 *  and the #IPDR_EVENT_RECORD_LOST event is raised. (The reasons for
 *  throwing away the new record and not removing the oldest record
 *  are (a) it's much more complicated to program and (b) the oldest
 *  record might be partially transmitted and there is no way in
 *  general to abort its transfer.
 *
 *  The queue size affects the configuration of a de-duplicator (see
 *  @ref IPDR_reliability_deduplication for more details).
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_reliability_deduplication De-duplication
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  Fail-over can result in duplicate records being sent. This
 *  is because a connection can be lost while an acknowledgment is
 *  being transmitted. For this reason, any robust IPDR collector must
 *  also be used with a de-duplicator (the IPDR protocol provides a
 *  "duplicate" flag, but this is only a hint and is not sufficient
 *  to prevent duplicates in allcases).
 *  The IPDR protocol provides a "boot time" field which,
 *  together with the DSN, can be used as a de-duplicator. Whenever
 *  IPDR_InitExporter() is called, the "boot time" is reset.
 *
 *  The de-duplicator should have room for at least as many records as
 *  the maximum that the internal queue can hold. That is its look-up
 *  table should contain at least this many entries:
 *  <br>queueMaxMemory ï¿½(minimum-record-size + 16) <br>The reasoning
 *  behind this is: Suppose all the records in the queue are sent
 *  before an acknowledgment is received.  When the connection is
 *  re-established, these records will all be re-sent, so the
 *  de-duplicator must have room to remember the oldest record in the
 *  queue.  In practice, the de-duplicator can keep fewer entries than
 *  this because of other considerations that will prevent sending all
 *  the records. However, a smaller de-duplication table is not
 *  recommended because of the variety of factors, some of which
 *  depend on how the platform implements TCP/IP.

/** @defgroup IPDR_sessions Sessions
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  A session is established to allow formatted records to be sent to
 *  one or more redundant collectors (servers). Records contain data organized
 *  into templates, which are referred to via keys that can be enabled
 *  and disabled. See section @ref IPDR_templates.
 *
 *  Multiple sessions can be created by the host application, for
 *  example to direct different types of data to different
 *  collectors (servers). Conversely, a transmitter (client) can send the same information to
 *  several collectors (servers) within a single session, for redundancy or load
 *  balancing purposes. (Load balancing will be fully supported in a
 *  future version.) In addition, templates are shared between
 *  sessions - the client can transmit data formatted by any template
 *  in any session.
 *
 *  A session has one or more collectors (servers) associated with it. When
 *  IPDR_SendData() is called, the record is sent to each session
 *  (unless template negotiation has turned off the sending for that
 *  session; the template negotiation is controlled by the collector).
 *  Each session has at most one active collector (server); an attempt is made to
 *  send the record to the active collector (server), with failover to alternate
 *  collectors (servers) if that fails. When the record has been acknowledged for
 *  all sessions, it is removed from the internal queue.
 *
 *  The state of sessions (i.e. the set of sessions and their
 *  associated collectors (servers)) can optionally be stored in non-volatile
 *  memory (see @ref IPDR_non_volatile_memory,
 *  @ref IPDR_MIB, @ref IPDR_MIB_related, and
 *  the <code>configurationCommandString</code> in @ref IPDR_transmitter_MIB).
 *  Parameter values can also be set via the
 *  parameters handler function (see
 *  @ref IPDR_initialization_starting_deletion and
 *  @ref IPDR_ParametersHandlerFunc).
 */


/** @defgroup IPDR_alternate_collectors Alternate collectors (servers) policy
 *
 *  <p><p>
 *  collectors (servers) are assigned priorities and different (multiple) collectors (servers)
 *  can have the same priority. Automatic switching to an alternate
 *  collector (server) occurs under the following conditions:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>The collector (server) sends a STOP message to the transmitter (client).
 *  <li>The transmitter's transport layer notifies the data layer of active
 *      collector (server) disconnection.
 *  <li>The transmitter (client) fails to receive an ACK for a prescribed
 *      duration. Collector(s) may send periodic "keep-alive" ACKs, using
 *      the most recent ACK message. However, the transmitter
 *      will ignore ACKs that do not increment the sequence number.
 *      The collector(s) may also send other messages such as
 *      STATUS REQ to verify that the TCP collection is alive but these
 *      messages do not cause the transmitter to adjust its notion
 *      of whether the collector is working or not. The reason for this
 *      is simple: the collector might be overloaded and able to only
 *      send ACKs but not actually process any of the records.
 *  <li>An ACK message was received from a higher priority collector (server) to
 *      which the transmitter (client) wasn't able to send data, due to reaching the
 *      window size limit.
 *  <li>A higher priority collector (server) acknowledged the reception of the
 *      current set of templates (TMPL DATA ACK / FINAL TMPL DATA ACK
 *      messages).
 *  <li>IPDR_RemoveServer() removes the collector (server).
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  In case one of the above conditions occur, the transmitter (client) sends data
 *  to the highest priority collector (server) which:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>has indicated that is started using a START message.
 *  <li>has acknowledged the current templates configuration (using
 *      TMPL DATA ACK / FINAL TMPL DATA ACK).
 *  <li>is connected at the transport layer level.

 *
 *  <p><p>

 *  message can have a Debug Level ranging from fatal errors
 *  (#IPDR_LEVEL_FATAL) to debug messages (#IPDR_LEVEL_DEBUG2). The
 *  host application may control the maximum message level which will
 *  be displayed in the log by each internal module of the IPDR
 *  transmitter (client). In addition the API provides capabilities which allow the
 *  host application to send messages to the IPDR log.
 *
 *  By default the IPDR transmitter (client) outputs its log messages by sending
 *  UDP datagrams (in syslog [RFC 3164] format) or to the process's
 *  standard error output (<code>stderr</code>) if
 *  #STD_FILE_OPERATIONS_SUPPORT is defined.
 *  IPDR_SetLogOutputCallback() or
 *  IPDR_SetLogOutputCallbackDetailed() can be used to override this
 *  default behavior and trigger a callback defined by the host
 *  application for each log message the transmitter (client) wishes to output.
 *
 *  That is, logging behavior is:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>If log output address and port are specified, send
 *      a UDP packet in syslog format (see IPDR_SetLogOutputAddress()
 *      and the <code>set_logger_addr</code> command to
 *      IPDR_DoConsoleCommand()).
 *  <li>If a callback exists, call it.
 *  <li>If neither a syslog packet were sent nor a callback
 *      was called, output to standard output (<code>stderr</code>).

 *  The memory service functions are used by the transmitter (client) to allocate
 *  and de-allocate memory during runtime. Some of the set-up
 *  parameters (such as <code>configuration.queueMaxMemory</code>) can be
 *  used to impose limits on parts of the IPDR memory allocation; you
 *  may wish to impose additional limits on the amount of memory that
 *  the IPDR transmitter (client) can allocate.
 *
 *  The memory used by IPDR transmitter (client) is allocated and de-allocated by
 *  functions supplied by the host application during
 *  initialization. To improve performance, the transmitter (client) uses internal
 *  memory pools that reduce the number of memory
 *  allocation/de-allocation requests. The IPDR transmitter (client) memory pools
 *  are based on pre-allocated, relatively large, memory chunks (more
 *  chunks can be allocated at runtime on a per need basis) out of
 *  which smaller buffers are efficiently allocated.
 *
 *  The following memory pools are used by the transmitter (client):
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt>queue<dd>a per session memory pool used for storing records.
 *  <dt>data_rcv<dd>a pool used for storing received messages (per collector (server) connection)
 *  <dt>data_snd<dd>a pool used for storing sent control messages (per collector (server) connection)
 *  <dt>send_buffer<dd>a small (< 100 bytes in most cases) memory
 *      region used for storing references to memory regions which are
 *     going to be sent over the transport layer (per collector (server) connection)
 *  </dl>
 *  Memory pools are allocated with an initial chunk size,
 *  pre-allocated number of chunks and have an optional size limit.
 *  Each has its own configuration parameter (see the
 *  various <i>xxx</i>MaxMem parameters described with ::IPDR_ParametersHandlerFunc).

/** Initialize a new transmitter (client) given the platform services and parameters.
 *
 *  The IPDR transmitter (client) initialization process involves passing a
 *  function pointer which will be used by the transmitter (client) to retrieve its
 *  parameters and a structure that contains function pointer to
 *  platform specific handlers. These implement socket, timer, and
 *  memory allocation operations. Initial parameters should be set
 *  before the transmitter (client) is activated or may be modified by setting
 *  different values to the MIB's relevant OIDs. Changing the
 *  parameters at run time may cause the connections to be restarted.
 *
 *  The implementation is free to use any method it wishes to store
 *  the parameter values. Examples are:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>As a pre-defined list (the sample code uses this method).
 *  <li>As an external file which is scanned for values.
 *  <li>As internal values which are set via a separate command line
 *  interface or via SNMP (as part of a MIB).
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  The \a ParamsHandlerArg parameter to the parameters handler
 *  function contains the necessary context for the implementation to
 *  fetch the values.
 *
 *  @note
 *
 *  If any subsequent function returns #IPDR_ERR_NOT_RUNNING,
 *  you must call IPDR_DeleteExporter() to clean things up before
 *  calling this function again.
 *
 *  It is undefined when the implementation calls the \a ParamsHandler.
 *  It may choose to collect all parameter the values during
 *  initialization; if your \a ParamsHandler changes its values after
 *  initialization, you must stop and start the transmitter (client) to make them
 *  take effect.
 *
 *  If you wish to give precedence to the values in the MIB, you can
 *  get at them with IPDR_MIBGetByName(). You must create the
 *  \a ParamsHandlerArg to contain a pointer to the \a transmitter (client) handle
 *  and test to ensure that the handle is non-NULL before using it
 *  (IPDR_InitExporter() will sufficiently instantiate the transmitter (client) to
 *  allow MIB lookups.
 *
 *  @param PS handle to a platform services structure supplied by the
 *                host application, containing pointers to service functions. The
 *                contents of this structure will depend on platform specifics.
 *  @param ExporterName name of the transmitter (client) (used for logging
 *                purposes). A copy is made of the string. If this
 *                parameter is NULL or zero-length, a default name is supplied.
 *  @param ParamsHandler callback function for initial values of parameters
 *                needed by the transmitter (client). Any values set by this callback
 *                can be changed before IPDR_StartExporter() by using
 *                IPDR_MIBSet().
 *                See additional comments with
 *                @ref IPDR_ParametersHandlerFunc.
 *                If this parameter is NULL, default values are used.
 *  @param ParamsHandlerArg argument to the \a ParamsHandler callback function.
 *  @param LoadMIB callback function for initializing the values in the MIB.
 *                 The function should limit its activity to calls to
 *                 IPDR_MIBRestoreNodeByName().
 *                 If this function fails (returns anything other than #IPDR_OK),
 *                 IPDR_InitExporter() will fail with the
 *                 same return value.
 *                 If this parameter is NULL, nothing is done for loading the MIB.
 *  @param LoadMIBArg passed to \a LoadMIB.
 *  @param SaveMIB callback function for saving the values in the MIB.
 *                 If this parameter is NULL, nothing is done for saving the MIB.

 *  <p><p>
 *  A host application can format data for transmission
 *  with a set of templates. Templates contain keys that can be
 *  dynamically enabled or disabled. They are a shared resource
 *  available to all sessions; the host application can define
 *  multiple templates to meet various BSS/OSS needs, and use them
 *  concurrently.  At the start of a session, the IPDR collector and
 *  transmitter 'negotiate' the data to be sent. The aim is to arrive at a
 *  'best fit' between data the platform can make available and the
 *  requirements of the business/support application(s) being used in
 *  a network.
 *
 *  Thus, the IPDR collector indicates which of the available templates
 *  are required and which keys within them are to be enabled or
 *  disabled. This can be done strictly with the XML configuraiton,
 *  or by some interaction by querying from the collector to the
 *  transmitter and then using a GUI to select which fields are actually wanted.
 *  The transmitter, based on the configuration information received
 *  from the collector, sends the collector an indication of the data
 *  formats (templates) it will use and after the collector confirms,
 *  sends only 'raw' data. The collector interprets this compact data
 *  using the templates it has agreed with the transmitter.
 *
 *  The host application uses the IPDR_SendData() function to
 *  populate data records in accordance with the template
 *  structures. The exporter filters out disabled keys and sends the
 *  record in the context of the appropriate sessions. The exporter code
 *  is free to reorder the fields in the template to something
 *  different from the ordering within the host application's records.
