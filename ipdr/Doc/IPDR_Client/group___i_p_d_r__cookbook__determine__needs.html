Considerations for transmitting data: <ul>
<li>
What kind of data will be transmitted? </li>
<li>
Are there better tools to use instead? </li>
<li>
Will it also work for future needs? </li>
</ul>
<p>
As its name states, IPDR is designed for sending "accounting" type data from network elements. IPDR is superior to the following following output mechanisms: <dl>
<dt>SNMP (MIBs): </dt>
<dd>IPDR can efficiently send much higher rates of data, and more reliably (SNMP is based on UDP). Also, IPDR is push-oriented, so the network element can control the rate at which data is sent (conventional SNMP leaves the network element at the mercy of the network management system's polling). </dd>
<dt>Log files: </dt>
<dd>IPDR avoids the need for disk space on network element. Also, it is a binary protocol, so precious processing time is not used in converting data to an ASCII or XML representation. </dd>
<dt>RADIUS accounting: </dt>
<dd>IPDR avoids some of the scalability issues of RADIUS; it is more reliable and has a simpler interface (the IPDR API handles issues of fail-over that typically must be explicitly programmed when using RADIUS). </dd>
<dt>TCP sockets: </dt>
<dd>IPDR takes care of the assembly and disaassembly of records and negotiation of content. It is also provides application-level reliability, to acknowledge when records have been processsed (TCP reliability only verifies that records have arrived) and supports fail-over to multiple collectors. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
The main requirements that were used to design the protocol were: <ul>
<li>
Aimed at accounting/logging needs: the data are structured into individual records with well-defined fields. Multiple record types are allowed. </li>
<li>
Real-time: minimal latency to deliver records. </li>
<li>
Scalable: support multiple devices at over 1000 records/sec each. </li>
<li>
Flexible: the transmitter (client) defines the data records and can change the content by adding new fields or by defining new record "templates". </li>
<li>
Reliable: ensures that every record is delivered and processed. </li>
<li>
Efficient: the protocol is as light-weight as possible (network elements spend their time doing network-related work and don't want to "waste" processing power on non-core tasks. </li>
<li>
Easy to deploy: simple API. </li>
<li>
Portable: all operating system functions are isolated for portability, so if you have an esoteric operating system that nobody else uses, the chances are good that IPDR can be quickly ported to it. </li>
</ul>
<p>
IPDR isn't for everybody. If you don't care about reliability, just use standard TCP sockets or even UDP. If you don't care about flexibility, hard-code your record formats. If you want free-form data transfer, IPDR might not do what you want. If you want two-way communication, consider some other protocol, such as HTTP or RADIUS (although IPDR is being extended to handle certain kinds of two-way communication, mainly additional acknowledgment from the collector (server), such as authorization).<p>
IPDR's flexibility is important for future-proofing your investment. You can add new record types and fields at any time, simply by installing a new version of your software that defines them. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon May 30 15:54:41 2005 by&nbsp;
