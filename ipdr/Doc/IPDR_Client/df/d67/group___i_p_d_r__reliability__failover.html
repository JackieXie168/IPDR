When a time-out occurs or the TCP connection is lost, the transmitter (client) fails over to the secondary collector (server). It also generates an "event" which the host can display and/or write to a log. The transmitter breaks the TCP connection, so that the collector (server) will reset its internal state and try to reconnect (e.g., if it has been too busy to acknowledge).<p>
When fail-over occurs, the IPDR code automatically re-sends all unacknowledged records to the secondary collector (server) (no special event is signaled for this; however a signal is generated for the change from primary to secondary collector). Because it is possible that a record has been received and processed but not acknowledged (e.g., if the connection went down just when the acknowledgment was being sent), duplicate records may exist. The processing for this is described in more detail below. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Apr 25 22:28:26 2005 for IPDRAPI by&nbsp;
