IPDR is designed to work on top of any reliable transport. The current implementation uses TCP but advantage could also be taken of SCTP in the future.<p>
TCP is reliable in the following sense: <ul>
<li>
Check-sums are calculated to ensure data integrity. </li>
<li>
TCP handles out-of-order and duplicate packets, to provide a reliable stream of bytes (i.e., all the packet handling is done by TCP; this allows IPDR records to be split across packets, transparently to the application). </li>
<li>
TCP retransmits packets if they are not acknowledged in time. This is transparent to the application, which only sees a stream of bytes. </li>
<li>
If packets cannot be delivered, eventually an error indication will be generated. However, the time for this is implementation-defined, and can be hours. </li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, TCP provides congestion control. TCP depends on IP for alternative routing of packets in an unreliable network.<p>
TCP does not provide application-level reliability. It only handles delivery of packets to the receiving machine. Applications that need the highest level of reliability must provide their own reliability mechanism.<p>
The TCP connection is made from the collector (server) to the transmitter (client). If there are multiple collectors (servers), there will be multiple connections to the transmitter; however only one is "active" at any time (the transmitter's configuration allows setting the priority of the collectors (servers)).<p>
Whenever a collector (server) loses connectivity with the transmitter (either because the network connection has broken in such a way that TCP sees the break; or because the transmitter has switched to another collector), the collector tries repeatedly to connect to the transmitter.<p>
There is no communication between the various collectors (servers) that are receiving data for any particular transmitter(s).<p>
The collector (server) can be configured so that a single collector (server) can receive from one or multiple transmitters. In general, it is recommended to have one transmitter (client) to one collector (server) unless the data rates are very low, in which case it is easier to configure multiple transmitters to a single collector (server).<p>
From a performance point of view, there is no significant difference between having multiple transmitters or a single transmitter to one collector (server). For configuration, a single collector (server) and multiple transmitters are easier to set up. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Apr 25 22:28:26 2005 for IPDRAPI by&nbsp;
