Fail-over can result in duplicate records being sent. This is because a connection can be lost while an acknowledgment is being transmitted. For this reason, any robust IPDR collector must also be used with a de-duplicator (the IPDR protocol provides a "duplicate" flag, but this is only a hint and is not sufficient to prevent duplicates in allcases). The IPDR protocol provides a "boot time" field which, together with the DSN, can be used as a de-duplicator. Whenever <a class="el" href="../../d3/d96/group___i_p_d_r__initialization__starting__deletion.html#ga3">IPDR_InitExporter()</a> is called, the "boot time" is reset.<p>
The de-duplicator should have room for at least as many records as the maximum that the internal queue can hold. That is its look-up table should contain at least this many entries: <br>
queueMaxMemory ï¿½(minimum-record-size + 16) <br>
The reasoning behind this is: Suppose all the records in the queue are sent before an acknowledgment is received. When the connection is re-established, these records will all be re-sent, so the de-duplicator must have room to remember the oldest record in the queue. In practice, the de-duplicator can keep fewer entries than this because of other considerations that will prevent sending all the records. However, a smaller de-duplication table is not recommended because of the variety of factors, some of which depend on how the platform implements TCP/IP. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Apr 25 22:28:26 2005 for IPDRAPI by&nbsp;
