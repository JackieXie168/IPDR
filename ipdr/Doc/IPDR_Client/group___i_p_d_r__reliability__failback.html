When the primary collector (server) comes back online, it connects to the transmitter (client), which switches back to transmitting to the primary collector (server). The transmitter treats this situation as if the secondary collector (server) had failed (that is, it ignores any further acknowledgments from the secondary) and retransmits all unacknowledged records. This behavior is slightly inefficient, because it could retransmit some records that have already processed by the secondary collector (server) and simply haven't been acknowledged; however, the decision was made to use simpler and more robust code rather than try to be of the utmost efficiency in a fairly rare situation. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon May 30 15:54:41 2005 by&nbsp;
